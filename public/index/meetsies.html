            Kiron and <a href="https://www.meetsies.com">Meetsies</a> are launching an unprecedented partnership to raise awareness and funding in order to support education and training of Belgium-based refugees. Those who want to contribute to this cause will be able, either to host dinners, either to participate in dinners as guest. All those who like to cook will be able to become the cook of one night and support refugees in a very personal way. They will only have to propose a menu and a price on <a href="https://www.meetsies.com">www.meetsies.com</a>. They will be able to choose to give part of all of the revenue of their dinner to Kiron. Thanks to these funds Kiron will be able to purchase computers to allow refugees to start their education, and get them a chance to better integrate in society.
